# Bafoonify
Spotify app for working with user data and playing mini games
To use it you'll need to run the .py file in your terminal (i.e. >python Bafoonify.py)
Recently converted to streamlit so now the files have been appropriately named Bafoonify-Streamlit.
To run them you need to cd the directory and use the command >streamlit run Bafoonify-Streamlit.py
